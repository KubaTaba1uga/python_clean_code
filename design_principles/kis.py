        KIS - Keep It Simple

        Don't over-engineer software components.

        The simpler design is, the more maintainable
            it become.

        Code is mostly readen, so keep it as most
            understanable as it is possible, without
            need to add comments or explanations.

        Variables, arguments or functions names
            are easiest way of docummenting the code.
