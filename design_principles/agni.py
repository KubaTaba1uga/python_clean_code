        AGNI - Ain't Gonna Need It

        Respond to present requirements, early
            optimization is source of evil.

        Requirements can change in time, in a way
            that is impossible to predict, so it is
            pointless to create the most complex
            scenarious in advance.

        Create as small and simple solution as possible.

        As in Unix philosophy:
            Do one thing only and do it well
