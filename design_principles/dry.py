        DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

        Knowledge in code, should be represnt only once.
        When change has to be made, only one rightful 
            location should be modified.

            Prons:
                 -   Robustness (less bugs in case of code change)
                 -   Realiability  (only one source of truth)
                 -   No  Ripple Effects (code is more cohensive)
