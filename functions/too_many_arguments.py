"""
    Functions should have maximum 5-6 arguments.

    If this value is exceeded consider patterns like:
        1. encapsulate arguments into seperate class
        2. use data structures to group argumnents 
        3. pack arguments using * operator
        4. pack arguments using ** oprerator

    Using pattern 3. or 4. make sure that function is well 
        documented, upon concern of loosing function
        signature. * or ** doesn't restrict number of arguments
        or  seperate names for them, that's why it
        is important.

    Many numbers of function arguments is a bad practice
        and could be treat as code smell !!!
